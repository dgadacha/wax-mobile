# CLAUDE.md — Wax mobile codebase map

This file is for **you, future Claude**. Read it first when starting a session on `wax-mobile`. It is a mobile-first fork of the desktop Wax app (Electron + Vue 3) — the desktop version still lives at `dgadacha/wax`; this repo (`dgadacha/wax-mobile`) only targets iOS + Android via **Capacitor**.

## TL;DR — what is this?

**Wax mobile** is a mobile music app for iOS + Android:
- **Frontend** — Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia + **Vant** (mobile UI kit) + **Lucide** icons, wrapped in **Capacitor** to produce `.ipa` / `.apk`. Multi-profile (Netflix-style "Qui écoute ?" gate at launch).
- **Backend** — `server.cjs` (Express) shells out to `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg`. Same code as the desktop project, just renamed `.cjs` because the package is now `"type": "module"`. Per-profile library/playlists storage; audio MP3s shared across profiles. Packaged as a Docker image and deployed to k8s (Cloudflare Tunnel in front).

## Quick reference

```bash
# Frontend
npm install                        # vue + vite + vant + capacitor (cli + plugins)
npm run dev                        # vite dev server on :5173, proxies /api → :3000
npm run build                      # dist/ — webDir consumed by Capacitor

# Backend
node server.cjs                    # Express on :3000 (needs yt-dlp + ffmpeg on PATH)

# Capacitor (run after `npm run build`)
npx cap add ios                    # first time only; needs Xcode
npx cap add android                # first time only; needs Android Studio
npm run ios                        # build + cap sync ios + cap open ios
npm run android                    # build + cap sync android + cap open android

# Docker / k8s
docker build -t registry.gitlab.com/kidnar/wax:latest .
docker push registry.gitlab.com/kidnar/wax:latest
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

Dev URLs: Vite at `http://localhost:5173`, Express at `http://localhost:3000`. Vite proxies `/api/*`, `/audio/*`, `/preview-files/*` → `localhost:3000` (override target via `VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET`).

Runtime deps (PATH for `server.cjs`): `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`. The Docker image installs both; override with `WAX_YT_DLP` / `WAX_FFMPEG` env vars.

## API base URL — Capacitor vs dev

Capacitor packages the built `dist/` into the native app and serves it from `capacitor://localhost` (iOS) / `https://localhost` (Android) inside a WebView. There is no Vite dev server in prod, so relative URLs like `/api/library` would hit the WebView's own origin and fail.

`src/lib/api.js` exports `apiUrl(path)` which prefixes `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` to any backend-bound path, and `apiUrlWithProfile(path)` which additionally appends `?profile=<id>` for SSE endpoints (EventSource can't set headers). Every place that constructs a URL the backend needs to serve **must** go through one of these:

- Regular requests: `fetch('/api/...')` → `api()` (auto-prefixes + sets `X-Wax-Profile`) or raw `fetch(apiUrl('/api/...'), { headers: { 'X-Wax-Profile': … } })`
- SSE: `new EventSource(apiUrlWithProfile('/api/...'))`
- `audio.src = track.file` → `audio.src = apiUrl(track.file)`
- `audio.src = '/api/stream/<id>'` → `audio.src = apiUrl('/api/stream/<id>')`
- `<img :src="track.thumbnail">` — wrapped at the mobile-shell call sites: `MobileHero`, `MobileTrackCell`, `MobilePlayer`, `ViewHome`, `ViewLibrary`. The legacy desktop components (`TrackRow`, `Player.vue`, `NowPlaying`, `BigPicture`, `Sidebar`, `QueueItem`, `DiscoverGrid`, `BulkAddBody`) still bind raw strings — they're no longer mounted in the mobile shell, only kept on disk for reference.

In dev, leave `VITE_API_BASE_URL` empty (default in `.env.example`) and the Vite proxy handles forwarding. In Capacitor builds, set it to the deployed backend URL (e.g. `https://wax-api.nc-maiz.org`) before running `npm run build && cap sync`.

## Multi-profile (Netflix-style)

Every backend request carries `X-Wax-Profile: <id>`; the server routes to `library/users/<id>/library.json` + `library/users/<id>/playlists.json`. Audio MP3s, covers, artist photos and Deezer caches stay shared at the library root — they're keyed by ytId / artist name so per-user duplication would be wasteful.

- **Default profile** (`id: 'default'`) is auto-created on first boot. If a legacy root `library/library.json` exists from a pre-multi-profile install, it's auto-migrated into `users/default/`.
- **Client store**: `src/stores/profile.js` holds the profile list + active id (persisted in `localStorage` under `wax:active-profile`). `api.js` reads the same key directly so it works without a Pinia round-trip.
- **`<ProfileGate />`** (mounted in `App.vue`) blocks the UI behind a full-screen "Qui écoute ?" overlay whenever `profile.needsPicker` is true. Includes inline profile creation (name + color picked from `ACCENT_SWATCHES`) and a "Gérer les profils" toggle that exposes rename / delete affordances on existing avatars (except `default`, which is undeletable).
- **`/api/profiles`** endpoints: `GET` lists, `POST {name, color}` creates, `PATCH /:id {name?, color?}` updates, `DELETE /:id` removes (and `rm -rf`s the user's data dir; refuses to delete `default`).
- **Switching profiles** triggers a full `location.reload()` — every Pinia store re-fetches against the new `X-Wax-Profile`. Lazier in-place rehydration could replace this later but reload is bulletproof.
- **Album backfill across profiles**: `autoBackfillOnStartup` iterates `listProfileIds()` so every user's library gets the Deezer pass on server start. `scheduleAlbumBackfill(profileId, track, onComplete)` now takes an explicit profileId since it's also called from no-req contexts.

## Auth gate (optional, env-toggled)

Single-user login gate that fronts the entire app. Off by default (dev), on in production when the server is publicly reachable (Cloudflare Tunnel, k8s ingress, etc.). Sits *in front of* the profile gate — the user enters credentials once per device, then `<ProfileGate>` asks who's listening.

- **Toggle**: server-side via `WAX_AUTH_EMAIL` + `WAX_AUTH_PASSWORD` env vars. Both empty → middleware is a no-op and every `/api/*` route stays public, identical to pre-gate behaviour.
- **Token**: stateless HMAC-signed `<base64url(payload)>.<hex(hmac)>` where payload = `{email, exp}`, TTL 30 days. HMAC secret persisted in `library/.auth-secret` (auto-generated on first boot, mode 0600) so tokens survive server restarts. Delete that file to kill every existing session at once.
- **Middleware** (`server.cjs`): runs after the profile middleware, exempts `/api/auth/*` (login + verify) and the media proxies `/api/stream/`, `/api/cover/`, `/api/preview/`, `/api/artist-photo/` — `<audio>` and `<img>` can't send `Authorization` headers, and the static `/audio/*` files are also free (served by `express.static` before the gate). Reads token from `Authorization: Bearer …` header OR `?_token=` query param (latter is for SSE EventSource which also can't set headers).
- **Routes**:
  - `POST /api/auth/login {email, password}` — constant-time `timingSafeEqual` on sha256 hashes of both fields, returns `{token}` on success, `401 {error: 'Identifiants incorrects'}` otherwise. Returns `503 {error: 'Auth disabled'}` when env vars aren't set.
  - `GET /api/auth/verify` — answers `{ok: true, authEnabled: bool}` either way. The `authEnabled` flag tells the client whether the empty-token case is "no gate" or "show form".
- **Client store** (`src/stores/auth.js`): `{token, authEnabled, checking}` state. `loggedIn` getter is `!authEnabled || !!token` so a no-auth server has every user "logged in" by definition. `verify()` probes `/api/auth/verify` on mount, sets `authEnabled` from the response, clears token on 401. `login()` POSTs creds, saves token in `localStorage['wax:auth-token']`. `logout()` just clears local state (no server-side revocation since the HMAC is stateless — wait for the 30-day expiry, or delete `.auth-secret`).
- **`api.js`** sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request when a token is present, and appends `&_token=` to `apiUrlWithProfile()` for SSE endpoints. A 401 anywhere wipes the token + dispatches `wax:auth-expired` so the gate re-renders.
- **`<LoginGate />`** (`src/components/LoginGate.vue`): full-screen overlay (`z-index: 200`, opaque gradient bg), shown via `v-if="!auth.loggedIn"`. Email + password form, spinner while `auth.checking`. Once login succeeds the gate fades out and `App.vue`'s `watch(() => auth.loggedIn)` triggers `bootstrapAfterAuth()` (profile.fetch → library.fetch → playlists.fetch → discover.refresh).
- **Logout** lives in Settings → Profil (only renders when `auth.authEnabled`). Calls `auth.logout()` then `location.reload()` so every store boots from a clean slate.

## Accent color picker

`src/stores/prefs.js` exports `ACCENT_SWATCHES` (8 named hex values: violet, sky, emerald, amber, rose, crimson, lime, pearl) and `applyAccent(hex)` which converts to HSL and writes `--accent`, `--accent-bright`, `--accent-dark`, `--accent-soft`, `--accent-glow` on `documentElement`. The chosen swatch persists in `prefs.accentColor` (localStorage `ytmp3:prefs`) and re-applies on `prefs.load()`. The Settings screen renders the swatches as a grid of round dots — the active one shows a Lucide `Check` overlay. Profile avatar colors are independent (stored on the profile record).

## Safe areas

- `index.html` has `viewport-fit=cover` so `env(safe-area-inset-*)` resolves to real values on notched devices (iPhones, Android cutouts).
- `capacitor.config.json` sets `StatusBar.overlaysWebView: true` so the WebView slides under the status bar.
- `App.vue` uses `safe-area-inset-top` on the `<van-nav-bar>` and `safe-area-inset-bottom` on both the `<van-tabbar>` and the global `<van-action-sheet>` — Vant adds the right padding via the `van-safe-area-*` classes internally.
- `mobile.css` defines `--safe-top` / `--safe-bottom` as `env(safe-area-inset-*)`. The mini player (`bottom: calc(var(--tab-height) + var(--safe-bottom))`), the view-scroll's bottom padding, the `<ProfileGate>` overlay, and `MobileHero` consume them.
- **Gotcha — `<van-nav-bar fixed placeholder>` is broken with safe-area**: Vant's `placeholder` mirrors the base 46 px nav-bar height but ignores the safe-area-inset-top padding it adds, so content slides under the notch. The shell uses an in-flow nav-bar at the top of the flex column (`.app-shell` is already `display: flex; flex-direction: column`); scroll happens inside `.view-scroll`. Don't reintroduce `fixed placeholder`.
- **Gotcha — don't pad the wrapper of a `<van-nav-bar safe-area-inset-top>`**: it doubles up the inset. `MobilePlayer.vue`'s `.np-screen` learned this the hard way; no `padding-top` on the wrapper, the nav-bar inside handles it.

## Icons

The whole app uses **Lucide** (`lucide-vue-next`) — a single consistent SVG icon family, tree-shaken per import. `<van-icon>` is no longer used in the mobile shell except where Vant components render internal icons themselves (which we now override via `#icon` / `#left` slots).

Standard imports per file: `import { House, Search, Library, Settings, ChevronLeft, Heart, ... } from 'lucide-vue-next'`. Each icon is a component: `<Heart :size="20" :stroke-width="2" color="…" :fill="…" />`. Use `fill` to render filled variants (filled hearts for "liked", filled play arrows on the index column, etc.).

## Offline mode (PWA)

The service worker (`vite-plugin-pwa` / Workbox) makes the app **fully usable without network** within the limits of what's been cached. What works offline:

- **App shell** — precache pulls in every `**/*.{js,css,html,svg,png,ico,woff2}` from `dist/` at build time. Cold-start the PWA offline → the UI boots normally.
- **Auth verify** (`/api/auth/verify`) — `NetworkFirst` rule, 1-week cache. Boot probes the network with a 3 s timeout, falls back to the cached 200 when offline. As a belt-and-suspenders, `auth.verify()` also keeps the existing token optimistically when `navigator.onLine === false` — even on the first boot offline the user isn't stranded behind a login form.
- **Library + playlists** (`/api/library`, `/api/playlists`) — `NetworkFirst` with `cacheKeyWillBeUsed` that splices the `X-Wax-Profile` header into the cache key, so Profile A never serves Profile B's data from cache. 3 s network timeout, 20-entry / 30-day cache.
- **Profiles list** (`/api/profiles`) — `NetworkFirst`, global cache (no per-profile keying).
- **Covers** (`/api/cover/`) — `StaleWhileRevalidate`, 500 entries, 30 days.
- **Downloaded MP3s** (`/audio/*.mp3`) — `CacheFirst`, 500 entries, 1 year, `rangeRequests: true` so `<audio>` can seek inside cached files. Tracks with `t.file` filled play offline; tracks without it skip with the standard player error toast.

What does **not** work offline (by design):
- Search (`/api/search`) — hits YouTube via yt-dlp, can't be cached meaningfully.
- Mix / Discover — same; the `online` event handler in `App.vue` re-fires `discover.refresh()` automatically when network returns.
- Streaming (`/api/stream/`) — only "downloaded" tracks play offline. Streaming requires fresh CDN URLs from yt-dlp.
- New downloads (`POST /api/library/:trackId/download`) — needs the network obviously. The library store catches the failure and toasts.

UX hints:
- **Banner**: `App.vue` mounts `<div class="offline-banner">Mode hors ligne</div>` between the nav-bar and view scroll whenever `navigator.onLine` flips false. Amber, in-flow so view content slides down by the banner's height.
- **LoginGate offline state**: when offline AND no token (fresh install, post-logout), the gate swaps the form for a `<WifiOff>` icon + "Pas de connexion" message instead of letting the user mash a button that's guaranteed to 401.
- **SSE channels skip at boot when offline**: `library._listenAlbumProgress()` + `discover.refresh()` are gated behind `isOnline.value` so we don't spam reconnect attempts. The `online` window event re-triggers both when connectivity returns.

## File map (where things live)

### Backend
- **`server.cjs`** — Express, single file, identical to the desktop project's `server.js` (just renamed because of `"type": "module"`). All endpoints preserved: search (`ytsearch10:`), playlist enumeration, single-track stream URL extraction (`-g`), MP3 download (`-x --audio-format mp3`), Mix enumeration (`RD<id>`), Deezer album lookup, YouTube artist photo scrape, cover proxy with disk cache. yt-dlp concurrency limited to 3 via the `runYtDlp` semaphore. SSE on `/api/jobs/:id/progress` for downloads and `/api/album-progress` for the auto-backfill stream.
- See the desktop CLAUDE.md (in `dgadacha/wax`) for the long-form description of every endpoint and pipeline — they are unchanged here.

### Capacitor
- **`capacitor.config.json`** — `appId: org.nc-maiz.wax`, `webDir: dist`. iOS + Android schemes are set so the WebView origin is stable. SplashScreen + StatusBar plugins are configured for the dark palette (`#0d0f14`).
- **`ios/`** + **`android/`** — Native projects. NOT committed by default; generated by `npx cap add ios` / `npx cap add android`. Re-add on a fresh checkout.

### Docker / k8s
- **`Dockerfile`** — Two-stage: `deps` installs production npm deps, `runtime` installs python3 + ffmpeg + latest `yt-dlp` from GitHub releases, copies `server.cjs` + node_modules in, runs as a non-root `wax` user on port 3000. The frontend is NOT shipped in the image — Capacitor bundles it into the native app.
- **`k8s/`** — calqued on the kuro project structure:
  - `namespace.yaml` — `wax` namespace.
  - `deployment.yaml` — `replicas: 1`, `strategy: Recreate` (the JSON library files live on a RWO PVC), TCP probes on :3000, 2-core CPU limit (yt-dlp can spike during signature extraction), `imagePullSecrets: gitlab-registry`.
  - `service.yaml` — ClusterIP, :80 → :3000.
  - `ingress.yaml` — Traefik internal (`wax.maiz.local`); public access is through a Cloudflare Tunnel (same pattern as kuro).
  - `pvc.yaml` — RWO 10 GiB for `/data` (library JSON + audio MP3s + covers).

### Frontend (`src/`)

**Entry point**: `src/main.js` imports Vant CSS + `mobile.css`, creates the Pinia store, mounts `App.vue` to `#app`.

**`App.vue`** — Mobile shell:
- Top: `van-nav-bar` (dynamic title from `view.name`, left arrow when in a sub-view; title hidden on top-level tabs so each view's own big heading owns the visual hierarchy — Spotify pattern).
- Middle: `.view-scroll` container that renders the active view via `v-show` (home / download / library / settings — top-level tabs) or `v-if` for the drill-down sub-views (playlist / album / artist / mix).
- `<MobilePlayer />` — mini bar always visible above the tab bar; tap to expand into a fullscreen `van-popup`.
- Bottom: `van-tabbar` with 4 items (Accueil / Rechercher / Bibliothèque / Réglages).
- `<ModalRoot />` for confirm/prompt/lyrics modals (legacy imperative API, works on mobile for `promptModal` text-input flows that Vant doesn't natively cover — playlist create/rename, for example).

The `view` store still drives "current page + back stack", same as desktop. `SUBVIEW_PARENT` in `App.vue` maps `playlist` / `album` / `artist` to the `library` tab (Spotify-style "drill from your library"), and `mix` to the `download` tab.

**`src/views/`** — Status of each view in the mobile world:
- `ViewHome.vue` — **New, mobile-only**. Greeting ("Bonjour" / "Bonsoir" by hour), a 2-col "récemment écoutés" pill grid (from the player queue, falls back to favorites), and a 2-col "Pour toi" cover grid backed by the `discover` store. Refresh button re-rolls the seed.
- `ViewSearch.vue` — **Rewritten mobile**. `van-search` + custom track cells. Tap row → stream, heart icon → add/remove from favorites. URL-paste flow (preview / playlist enumeration / download to library) is NOT ported yet — the desktop search store still supports it but the mobile view ignores it.
- `ViewLibrary.vue` — **Unified Spotify-style bib**. Sticky `van-search` + horizontal chips (`Tout` / `Playlists` / `Albums` / `Artistes` / `Titres`). `Tout` shows playlists + albums + artists as cards (cover/photo + name + meta); `Titres` switches to the favorites track list with action-sheet on the `…` button. Tapping a card pushes the corresponding detail view via `view.switchTo(...)`. The `Playlists` chip surfaces a "Nouvelle playlist" row that calls the legacy `playlists.create()` (which opens its `promptModal` via ModalRoot).
- `ViewPlaylist.vue` — **Rewritten mobile**. `<MobileHero>` with the first track's cover + gradient fallback + "Playlist" eyebrow + `+` and `…` action buttons. Action sheet on `…` exposes rename / add tracks / download all / delete. Per-row action sheet on each track's `…`.
- `ViewAlbum.vue` — **Rewritten mobile**. `<MobileHero>` with the Deezer album cover. Tracklist uses the same Deezer canonical order + library-match logic as the desktop view, with `MobileTrackCell` in `index` variant: matched tracks play immediately, unmatched ones resolve to YouTube on first tap (loading spinner on the index). "Sauvegarder comme playlist" lives in the `…` action sheet — kept the inline implementation rather than depending on legacy code.
- `ViewArtist.vue` — **Rewritten mobile**. `<MobileHero shape="circle">` with the scraped artist photo (via `apiUrl('/api/artist-photo/...')`). Two sections: "Dans ta bibliothèque" and "Recommandé" (filtered to tracks that cluster under the same `normalizeArtistKey`). "Tout aimer" button on the recos section batches `lib.add({silent:true})`.
- `ViewMix.vue` — **Rewritten mobile**. `<MobileHero>` with the first track's cover, "Sauvegarder" pill button in the actions slot. Track list uses `thumb` variant of `MobileTrackCell`.
- `ViewSettings.vue` — **Mobile-only**. `van-cell-group` cards for Bibliothèque counts, version, backend URL, and a "Tout effacer" danger row that confirms via `showConfirmDialog`. Theme picker / language / EQ / backup / playlists management are NOT ported yet.
- `ViewAlbums.vue` — **Removed from routing**. The unified `ViewLibrary` handles the album grid via the `Albums` chip; the legacy view file remains on disk but is no longer imported.

**`src/components/`** — Mobile additions vs legacy:
- `MobileHero.vue` — **New**. Reusable detail-page hero: blurred backdrop derived from the cover, eyebrow + title + subtitle stacked, square or circular cover, right-aligned `actions` slot (action-sheet trigger, etc.), and a round play FAB. Used by ViewPlaylist / ViewAlbum / ViewArtist / ViewMix.
- `MobileTrackCell.vue` — **New**. Reusable list row with `thumb` or `index` variant (number column for albums/playlists, cover thumbnail for search/mix). Emits `play` / `like` / `more` so the parent can wire the right action sheet.
- `MobilePlayer.vue` — **New**. Hosts both `<audio>` elements (so the legacy `player` store's `bindAudio()` still works) + the mini player + the fullscreen `van-popup` with cover, seek (`van-slider`), prev/next, like, lyrics, queue.
- `Player.vue`, `NowPlaying.vue`, `BigPicture.vue`, `Sidebar.vue` — **Legacy desktop, no longer imported by App.vue**. Kept on disk for reference. Safe to delete later.
- `TrackRow.vue`, `TrackListHeader.vue`, `JobItem.vue`, `QueueItem.vue`, `DiscoverGrid.vue`, `Toast.vue`, `SettingsBody.vue` — legacy, no longer referenced. Kept for reference.
- `ModalRoot.vue`, `BulkAddBody.vue`, `AddToPlaylistBody.vue` — **Still used**. `ModalRoot` is mounted by App.vue because the legacy imperative `promptModal` / `openComponentModal` flows (playlist create/rename, bulk-add to playlist) are still wired through it. They render the desktop look-and-feel inside a centered overlay — works on mobile but doesn't match Vant's bottom-sheet aesthetic; consider re-skinning if it bothers you.

**`src/composables/`**:
- `useVisualizer.js`, `useLyrics.js`, `useDragReorder.js` — legacy, still on disk. `useLyrics` is wired into the fullscreen `MobilePlayer` comment-icon button.

**Action sheets**: `src/stores/actionSheet.js` is a **singleton** Pinia store wrapping `<van-action-sheet>`. Mounted exactly once at the bottom of `App.vue`; every view calls `useActionSheetStore().open([{name:'…'}, …])` and awaits `{ index, name }`. Don't drop per-view `<van-action-sheet>` elements — multiple views stay mounted via `v-show` and their sheets would all teleport to `body`, so clicks could fire the wrong handler. (We hit this exact bug: 5 options stacked with 4 more, mix action ended up triggering the wrong index.) Vant 4 ships ActionSheet as a component only — there's no imperative helper, hence the store wrapper.

**`src/stores/`** — Pinia stores all preserved from the desktop project, nothing renamed. The shared model means a port can swap views in place without touching state:
- `library.js`, `playlists.js`, `player.js`, `prefs.js`, `view.js`, `mix.js`, `search.js`, `streams.js`, `discover.js`, `jobs.js`, `accent.js`.
- `accent.js` is unused in the mobile shell (mobile.css has a hardcoded palette) but kept around in case the theme picker is ported.

**`src/lib/`** — Preserved + extended:
- `api.js` — now exports `apiUrl(path)` alongside `api(path, opts)`. See the "API base URL — Capacitor vs dev" section above.
- `format.js`, `icons.js`, `themes.js`, `i18n.js`, `modal.js`, `toast.js`, `backup.js` — unchanged from desktop. `backup.js` was sweeped to use `apiUrl()` for `/api/export`, `/api/import`, `/api/wipe`.

**`src/styles/`**:
- `mobile.css` — **New**. CSS-vars palette (single "Midnight" dark theme for now), Vant `--van-*` overrides, layout primitives (`.app-shell`, `.view-scroll`, `.tab-bar`, `.mini-player`), and the `.track-cell` base used by Search + Library mobile views.
- `style.css` — **Legacy desktop, no longer imported**. ~1700 lines. Kept on disk for reference while porting the remaining views (a lot of details like the `.eq` visualizer SVG transforms, hero band gradients, theme blocks for the 22-theme picker live there).

## Key flows (data flow tracing)

### Search → stream a track (mobile)
1. User types in `van-search` → `ViewSearch.onSearchInput` updates `search.inputValue` and calls the debounced `makeSearchHandler` (500 ms).
2. `search.runSearch` decides URL vs free-text. For text: `api('/api/search?q=...')` → `search.results`.
3. Tap a result → `streams.streamSearchResult(r, null, player)` registers a virtual `stream-<ytId>` track, sets `player.queue = [streamId]`, and the player loads `apiUrl('/api/stream/:ytId')`.
4. Audio element is in `MobilePlayer.vue`, bound to the `player` store via `player.bindAudio(audioRef, audio2Ref)` on mount.

### Library track → offline
Same `lib.downloadTrack(trackId)` → POST `/api/library/:id/download` → SSE `/api/jobs/:jobId/progress` → local mutation on `lib.findById(trackId).file`. Available from the action sheet on every track row + "Tout télécharger" in playlist headers.

**Client-side download pool** (mobile-specific): `lib.downloadTrack` no longer fires the POST + opens the SSE immediately. Instead it marks the row `{progress: 0, phase: 'queued'}` for instant UI feedback, then `await`s `_acquireDownloadSlot()` — a 4-wide semaphore. Browsers cap HTTP/1.1 to ~6 connections per origin, so firing 50 SSEs at once (50-track Mix → "Tout télécharger") would saturate the cap and 44 would stall PENDING with no progress events ever. The pool sits at 4 to leave headroom for the album-progress SSE + ad-hoc fetches; the server's yt-dlp semaphore is 3 so one slot is always queue-warming. Each `_listenLibraryProgress` calls `_releaseDownloadSlot` on `ready` / `error` / SSE-`onerror` (single-fire via a `released` flag) to keep the queue moving. The old `es.onerror = () => es.close()` left ghost entries forever — now the row drops + slot releases on any failure.

## Conventions / style (mobile-specific)

- **Vant**: components are auto-imported via `unplugin-vue-components` + `@vant/auto-import-resolver` (see `vite.config.js`). You can use `<van-button>`, `<van-cell>`, etc. directly in templates without imports. For imperative APIs (`showToast`, `showConfirmDialog`, `showNotify`) and the type for setup state, import from `'vant'` explicitly. The base CSS bundle `vant/lib/index.css` is loaded once in `main.js`.
- **Safe areas**: every fixed element honors `env(safe-area-inset-top/bottom)` via the `--safe-top` / `--safe-bottom` CSS vars defined in `mobile.css`. The nav bar, tab bar, and mini player are the three callers — if you add another fixed element, pad it the same way.
- **Single theme for now**: only "Midnight" (dark). The desktop's 22-theme picker is not ported. When/if it lands, palette vars from `mobile.css` move into per-theme `html.theme-<id>` blocks like the desktop, and the Vant `--van-*` overrides re-derive from them.
- **i18n**: legacy `lib/i18n.js` is still on disk but the mobile views use raw French strings inline for now. To bring i18n back, call `t('...')` and add to both `en` / `fr` catalogs — same convention as desktop.
- **Composition API + `<script setup>`** only.

## Capacitor native + background audio

`npx cap add ios` / `npx cap add android` have been run once and the `ios/` + `android/` folders are gitignored. On a fresh checkout the user runs them again locally. The post-`cap add` (or `cap sync`) workflow is:

```bash
npm run build         # vite → dist/
npx cap add ios       # or `cap add android` (first time per platform)
npm run cap:setup     # idempotent patches — see scripts/setup-native.mjs
npm run ios           # build + sync + setup + open Xcode (composite)
```

`scripts/setup-native.mjs` is a Node script that applies — idempotently — the patches needed for background audio. Re-runs are safe (each patch checks for a sentinel string). Applied edits:

- **iOS Info.plist** : adds `UIBackgroundModes = [audio]` so iOS keeps the WebView's `<audio>` alive when the device locks. Without it, audio stops within ~2 s of locking.
- **iOS AppDelegate.swift** : imports `AVFoundation` + `MediaPlayer`, sets `AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback, mode: .default)` and `setActive(true)` in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, then calls `beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents()` so the lock-screen / Control Center transport reaches the page's MediaSession handlers.
- **Android AndroidManifest.xml** : adds `WAKE_LOCK`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permissions. (Android Chromium honors `<audio>` + Media Session API in background by default, but the FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK permission is required on Android 14+ to declare the playback intent.)

The page-side Media Session API setup already lives in `src/stores/player.js` (`setupMediaSession()` registers `play/pause/previoustrack/nexttrack/seekto` action handlers and `_updateMediaMetadata()` pushes `MediaMetadata{title, artist, album, artwork}` on every track change). iOS picks this up automatically once `beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents` is called.

`npm run cap:sync` wraps `cap sync && npm run cap:setup` so the patches reapply automatically after each sync (Capacitor sometimes regenerates parts of the native projects).

## Active TODOs / known gaps

- Native projects (`ios/`, `android/`) not committed — `cap add` regenerates them per-checkout. Icons + splash artwork still need to be set in Xcode / Android Studio.
- Offline storage: download flow still writes to `server.cjs`'s `library/audio/<id>.mp3` (server-side filesystem). For Capacitor, the client should download via `@capacitor/filesystem` so MP3s sit on the device storage, not the backend's PVC. Big architectural shift — design decision pending.
- Prefs storage still uses `localStorage`. Could migrate to `@capacitor/preferences` for better iOS sandboxing, but localStorage works in the WebView so this is optional.
- `SettingsBody.vue` (legacy desktop settings) NOT ported. The mobile `ViewSettings.vue` covers profile / accent / library counts / reset; theme picker (22 themes) / language / EQ / backup are still pending.
- Drag-reorder on Playlist track list not ported (was HTML5 DnD on desktop; mobile needs `van-draggable` or a long-press handle).
- Playlist create / rename still goes through the legacy `promptModal` (mounted via `ModalRoot.vue`) because Vant has no text-input dialog. Profile rename uses a native `window.prompt` for the same reason — consider building a `MobilePromptSheet`.
- Lyrics modal (opened from `MobilePlayer`'s comment icon) is the legacy desktop modal.
- Profile avatars are letter-on-color circles only — no upload-an-image-from-the-camera flow. Capacitor `@capacitor/camera` could do it but adds permissions complexity.
- No tests, no CI for the mobile build yet.

## Communication style

- French, casual. The user says "tu" and writes informally.
- Explain decisions briefly when proposing options. Confirm before destructive changes.
- The user values **performance** and **polish**: small UX issues (alignment, perceived latency, jank, safe-area mistakes) get flagged.
- They often iterate: small change → review → next ask. Don't over-engineer.

## Workflow: "commit et pousse" / "commit and push"

When the user asks to commit & push (any phrasing — "commit et pousse", "commit and push", "push", "envoie ça", etc.), do all four of these in **one** flow before pushing:

1. **Bump the version** in `package.json`.
   - Default: **patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) — bug fix, polish, doc-only.
   - **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) — new screen, new public store action, new Capacitor plugin.
   - **Major** (0.x → 1.0.0) — only when the user asks for it explicitly, or for a breaking change they flagged. We are pre-1.0 for now.
2. **Update `README.md`** if the change is user-visible (new feature, new install step, new dep). Skip if it's an internal refactor or tiny fix.
3. **Update `CLAUDE.md`** if architecture, files, stores, key flows, gotchas, or active TODOs shifted. Skip for cosmetic-only fixes.
4. **Then commit and push** in a single commit. Don't ask permission for any of the four — just do them. If a step is genuinely a no-op (e.g. CLAUDE.md needs no change), say so in one line in the reply.

Commit message: imperative, French or English (match the codebase). Do NOT prepend `vX.Y.Z:` — the version lives in `package.json`, not in commit subjects.
